Use the best model from testing on the whole NGSBNC dataset for further finetuning on a part of the NGSBNC and testing on the NGSBNC heldout testset. This is the model using nbbert-large as its language model, and batch size = 16. 
Perform finetuning to see if this improves the performance, and to see how much performance is improved when the size of the finetuning data varies.
